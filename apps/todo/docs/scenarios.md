# Real-Life Use Cases

## 1. Smart Task Scheduling
- Schedule long tasks (4+ hours) across multiple days in optimal time slots
- Respect natural energy levels (scheduling complex tasks during high-energy morning hours)
- Handle work across different time zones (DEEP/LIGHT/ADMIN zones)
- Maintain project task sequences from Todoist
- Preserve existing calendar commitments

## 2. Intelligent Task Splitting
- Split large tasks into manageable chunks (e.g., 6-hour task into 2-hour segments)
- Maintain minimum productive duration (no chunks smaller than specified time)
- Respect maximum split limits (prevent over-fragmentation)
- Add necessary buffer time between chunks
- Schedule splits across optimal time periods (e.g., morning DEEP work zones)

## 3. Conflict Management
- Detect and handle overlapping meetings/events
- Manage transitions between different work zones
- Handle energy level mismatches
- Maintain required buffer times between tasks
- Validate zone compatibility for tasks

## 4. Advanced Rescheduling
- Handle new calendar conflicts
- Reschedule dependent tasks together
- Maintain task relationships during rescheduling
- Clean up and reorganize scheduled blocks
- Preserve fixed/unmovable calendar events

## 5. Work Pattern Optimization
- Optimize for personal energy patterns
- Match tasks to appropriate work zones
- Maintain focus time blocks
- Handle buffer requirements between different types of work
- Support different energy level requirements

## 6. Project Sequencing
- Maintain logical task order within projects
- Handle cross-project task dependencies
- Respect due dates while maintaining sequences
- Optimize task order for productivity
- Handle priority changes

## Real-World Examples:

1. Knowledge Worker Daily Planning:
   - Morning: Deep focus tasks in 2-3 hour blocks
   - Afternoon: Lighter tasks and meetings
   - Buffer times for context switching

2. Project Management:
   - Sequential task scheduling
   - Dependency management
   - Cross-project coordination
   - Due date alignment

3. Flexible Work Patterns:
   - Split long tasks across multiple days
   - Adapt to calendar changes
   - Maintain productivity zones
   - Handle meeting interruptions

4. Team Coordination:
   - Respect fixed meeting times
   - Schedule around team availability
   - Maintain project sequences
   - Handle cross-timezone work
